ABOUT - ME Guessing number and fav athletes game

I added addtional feature that asks user to guess what number I am thinking of and my fav athletes. I let them try certain number of times and if they did not get it right it breaks out of the loop and give them the correct answer.

Reflections and Comments : Arrays, Loops and nested loops are used to go through the iteration and break out until the condition is false.
